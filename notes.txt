At a very simple level, programming can be separated into three basic areas.
Databases, the BackEnd, and the FrontEnd.

Databases store organised information, and can be imagined a bit like a table or
an excel spreadsheet. It runs on a server remote from the User's device.

The BackEnd handles this data, and the user's input. It also runs on a server remote
from the User's device.

The FrontEnd part of an app is what displays the information to the viewer, and
runs on the client (browser or mobile device).

Even if your have a preference for a certain area of coding, and intend to specialise
in one area exclusively, at this stage learning the foundation of each area still has
value. Seeing how they work together will give you an end to end understanding of
how websites and apps work, and will help you write code that coordinates better
with the rest of the website/app.

with an understanding of how the terminal works, we'll now try to get an
understanding of writing code, and running those files in the terminal to see the
output. At this beginning level, it gives us a nice environment to run and see the
output of the bits of code we'll start to write.

this is where we begin to look at 'programming', through the language of Python.

To begin with, there are some concepts common to all languages that you need to
get your head around; "Codecademy" and "Learn X the Hard Way are" great ways to
introduce you to foundational concepts, and to hit the ground running.

For this course you will need to complete the "Codecademy" section on Python, as
well as Zed Shaw's "LearnPythonTheHardWay". These will give you a solid foundational
understanding of both how Python and programming languages work.

Once complete, move onto the following tasks:

1. FizzBuzz
2. Anagram - is a word anagram or not?
3. Sign Up to "codewars" and get to 6kyu on Python
4. Writing Tests
5. Python OysterCard / Focus on User Stories and Tests

Now repeat them in Javascript!
