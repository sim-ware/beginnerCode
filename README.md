# Intro/Preface
This course aims to put together everything you need to know to become a Junior
Developer. The internet is an invaluable, exhaustive - but sometimes exhausting
resource for learning how to code. I will try to make this journey less daunting
for you by stringing together excellent and relevant teaching resources from the
internet, as well as explanations for their relevance.

# Start
#### Why Python?
We're using Python because as a language it's easier to pick up. Compared to languages like Javascript, Java and C, it is easier to read and write and has a lower barrier to entry. Another advantage in learning Python here is that it's the more industry ready language. I've seen more companies rely on Python, and it's a great language for Data Science, so learning it now sets you up to learn more about both development now, and Data Science in future.

#### Why HTML? Why CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS. Think of HTML as the foundation (every house has one), and CSS as the aesthetic choices (there’s a big difference between a Victorian mansion and a mid-century modern home).

#### Why JavaScript?
When the web was invented people were unsure of it was was going to do exactly. They new it needed to hold information and could send information but they weren't sure what kind of information it would send. The first major thing for the web was HTML of Hyper Text Markup Language. This HTML let people make text and link to it. Then people though... you know what would make this better. Pictures! So they added pictures and it was better. But then people wanted the pages to do other things... for example have a page automatically go to another page (Like redirect the page.) or to allow the user to type number in a box and get their sum like a calculator. So a company called ECMA International designed a way to tell the computer to do these things. It was called ECMAScript but the name was weird so they named it coffeeScript but then another company got involved so they called it JavaScript.
