with an understanding of how the terminal works, we'll now try to get an
understanding of writing code, and running those files in the terminal to see the
output. At this beginning level, it gives us a nice environment to run and see the
output of the bits of code we'll start to write.

this is where we begin to look at 'programming', through the language of Python.

To begin with, there are some concepts common to all languages that you need to
get your head around; "Codecademy" and "Learn X the Hard Way are" great ways to
introduce you to foundational concepts, and to hit the ground running.

For this course you will need to complete the "Codecademy" section on Python, as
well as Zed Shaw's "LearnPythonTheHardWay". These will give you a solid foundational
understanding of both how Python and programming languages work.

Once complete, move onto the following tasks:

1. FizzBuzz
2. Anagram - is a word anagram or not?
3. Sign Up to "codewars" and get to 6kyu on Python
4. Writing Tests
5. Python OysterCard / Focus on User Stories and Tests

Now repeat them in Javascript!
