# codeForDerps
The beginnings of a guide to take one from Derp to Dev

#Intro
So, you want to be a developer?

Maybe you want to a Back End Engineer, optimising your code to handle complex data.
Or, you might want to become a Front End Visionary, coding your websites and applications to look beautiful and handle interactions intuitively and seamlessly.

Maybe you don't know the difference between the two, but have seen world change
irreversibly over your lifetime to rely on technology increasingly, and excited
by its potential change and hopefully enhance the way we live and work.

Whatever your reason for wanting to learn to code, thank you sincerely for starting
here. Coding has become both a passion and a career for me, and to be able to help
anyone else who's as willing to learn, but as clueless as I was when I started,
would be a total honour.

#Who Am I?
why did i learn to code
-min wage
-clueless after uni after doing arts degree
-interest in music production
why i did a bootcamp
-steroid shot for my code
-what i got vs in the end you kind of do it by yourself
-you do your tech tests alone, you go to interviews alone
-on your job you may well be alone to fix a solution
-even when you're learning, your by yourself with the material as only you can
--really learn something, noone else can put something in your head and theres no
--real replacement for the volume of work to do to learn something
--IraGlass on beginners
-feels like theres a certain self-reliance you need for any career
why i think you don't need to

#Course Intro
This course aims to get someone from virtually no knowledge in the field of coding,
to be able to secure an entry level job in the industry. It will include mostly
programming information, but will also lean into a bit of interview and career advice.

At a very simple level, programming can be separated into three basic areas.
Databases, the BackEnd, and the FrontEnd.

Databases store organised information, and can be imagined a bit like a table or
an excel spreadsheet. It runs on a server remote from the User's device.

The BackEnd handles this data, and the user's input. It also runs on a server remote
from the User's device.

The FrontEnd part of an app is what displays the information to the viewer, and
runs on the client (browser or mobile device).

Even if your have a preference for a certain area of coding, and intend to specialise
in one area exclusively, at this stage learning the foundation of each area still has
value. Seeing how they work together will give you an end to end understanding of
how websites and apps work, and will help you write code that coordinates better
with the rest of the website/app.

Also, this course will aim to give you an understanding of the Terminal, and source
control(Git).

Developers use the terms Terminal, Command Line, Console and some others interchangeably.
Although there are subtle differences, they more or less refer to the same thing.
Normally you interact with visual icons to access Chrome, Word etc, and rely on
the nice high-definition screen to show you your instagrams and electronic mails,
and personal documents. The terminal is a basically a way of doing this with simple
text commands, and in a software development context, it's the environment where
we'll be running most of our code, so you need to learn it!

Git is a type of Source/Version Control that we will learn as it makes it easier
to track changes you make to files. For example, when you edit a file, git can help you determine exactly what changed, who changed it, and why. It will also let you revert
your code to previous states too.

It’s useful for coordinating work among multiple people on a project, and for tracking
progress over time by saving “checkpoints”. You could also use it while writing
an essay, or to track changes to artwork and design files.

Git isn’t the only version control system out there, but it’s by far the most popular. Many
software developers use git daily, and understanding how to use it can give a major boost
to your resume.
