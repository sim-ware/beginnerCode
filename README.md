# codeForDerps

So, you want to be a developer?

Maybe you want to a Back End Engineer, optimising your code to handle complex data queries.
Or, you might want to become a Front End Visionary, coding your websites and applications to look beautiful and handle user interactions intuitively and seamlessly.

Maybe you don't know the difference between the two, but have seen world change
irreversibly over your lifetime to rely on technology increasingly, and excited
by its potential change and hopefully enhance the way we live and work.

Whatever your reason for wanting to learn to code, thank you sincerely for starting
here. Coding has become both a passion and a career for me, and to be able to help
anyone else who's as willing to learn, but as clueless as I was when I started,
would be a total honour.
