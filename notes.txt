#### Terminal
"An interface where you can type and execute text based commands."

Also, this course will aim to give you an understanding of the Terminal, and source
control(Git).

Developers use the terms Terminal, Command Line, Console and some others interchangeably.
Although there are subtle differences, they more or less refer to the same thing.
Normally you interact with visual icons to access Chrome, Word etc, and rely on
the nice high-definition screen to show you your instagrams and electronic mails,
and personal documents. The terminal is a basically a way of doing this with simple
text commands, and in a software development context, it's the environment where
we'll be running most of our code, so you need to learn it!


#### Git
Git is a type of Source/Version Control that we will learn as it makes it easier
to track changes you make to files. For example, when you edit a file, git can help you determine exactly what changed, who changed it, and why. It will also let you revert
your code to previous states too.

It’s useful for coordinating work among multiple people on a project, and for tracking
progress over time by saving “checkpoints”. You could also use it while writing
an essay, or to track changes to artwork and design files.

Git isn’t the only version control system out there, but it’s by far the most popular. Many
software developers use git daily, and understanding how to use it can give a major boost
to your resume.
