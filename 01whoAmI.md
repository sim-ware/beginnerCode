## Who Am I?
My name's Samir, and I've been working as a developer for nearly two years. I would
consider myself a Junior to Mid Level developer.

I actually studied English at University, but when I graduated I found it difficult
to find work I found engaging. I worked for a while in Education, and in an office
for a bit. Every job I did involved a computer in some way - from holding records
of a student's progress, or a tenant's debt, to coordinating kitchen staff by prioritising
customer's meals in order of time they were requested. Even in my personal life,
my phone was my medium of arranging and getting to social events. And in my hobbies,
writing and recording music, computers granted me the toolset of a full studio
I could fit in my bag.

I used my experience in Education to start tutoring - a job that let me support
myself while still affording me the time to learn to programme. After a year of
Javascript, HTML, and CSS, I decided to enter a bootcamp. I felt the staff and
students would be a great support network in helping me land my first role.
Also, the discipline and structure of a course would be invaluable guidance, especially
when the internet has so many helpful but overwhelming resources. I kind of pictured
it as a steroid shot for my software CV.

I wanted to create a DIY from zero to developer guide. This isn't to shit on bootcamps;
I got all of the above out of my experience, and some - but they're expensive, intense, and not an option for everyone.

In the end you kind of do it by yourself anyway. You do your tech tests alone, you
go to interviews alone, and on your job you may well be alone to fix a solution.
Even when you're learning, you're really by yourself with the material as only you
can digest, process and understand a concept. No-one else can put something in
your head and there's no real replacement for the volume of work you have to do
to  really learn something new. Check out the video below by Ira Glass that helps to
explain what I mean. What this guide intends to do is to collate resources and
chain them together cohesively to help enable the reader to constructively do the
volume of work necessary to get to an entry level developer job.
