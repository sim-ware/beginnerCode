TERMINAL
get them to run through following resources:
https://mac.appstorm.net/how-to/utilities-how-to/how-to-use-terminal-the-basics/
https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/appendixa.html

with an understanding of how the terminal works, we'll now try to get an
understanding of writing code, and running those files in the terminal to see the
output. At this beginning level, it gives us a nice environment to run and see the
output of the bits of code we'll start to write.

this is where we begin to look at 'programming', through the language of Python.

Why Python?
We're using Python because as a language it's easier to pick up. Compared to languages
like Javascript, Java and C, it is easier to read and write and has a lower barrier
to entry.

Why not Ruby?
It's similar in syntax to Ruby - both are nimble and super-legible. I
think the advantage in learning Python here is that it's the more industry ready
language. I've seen more companies rely on Python, and it's a great language for
Data Science, so learning it now sets you up to learn more about Data Science in
future.

We're beginning at the BackEnd level because we can write and run code now without
having to worry about running a server, and seeing our results in a Browser.

To begin with, there are some concepts common to all languages that you need to
get your head around; "Codecademy" and "Learn X the Hard Way are" great ways to
introduce you to foundational concepts, and to hit the ground running.

For this course you will need to complete the "Codecademy" section on Python, as
well as Zed Shaw's "LearnPythonTheHardWay". These will give you a solid foundational
understanding of both how Python and programming languages work.

Once complete, move onto the following tasks:

1. FizzBuzz
2. Anagram - is a word anagram or not?
3. Sign Up to "codewars" and get to 6kyu on Python
4. Writing Tests
5. Python OysterCard / Focus on User Stories and Tests

Now repeat them in Javascript!
